##Coercion of Different Data Types

R will not stop you from entering different data types into a vector, but when you go to operate on the vector, R will have to "coerce" the data into being a uniform data type. This inevitably can cause issues. One way to solve this is to use a list. Lists are a vector that can contain multiple data types, and are very important in R.
```{r}
x <- 0:6    #Create a vector of numbers
class(x)    
as.numeric(x)
as.logical(x)
as.character(x)

##An example of coercion not working.
x <- c("a", "b", "c")
as.numeric(x)         #No way to make this work.
as.logical(x)         
as.complex(x)

##A list
x <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 1 + 4i)
x
```
